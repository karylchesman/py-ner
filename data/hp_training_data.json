Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped)that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangersthey were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him oncewhile out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harryfuriously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of theshop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all ingreen had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very longpurple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day andthen walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all thesepeople was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get acloser look.",
